# Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions

## Objective
To modularize SQL logic by creating reusable stored procedures and functions.

## What I Did
- Created a **stored procedure** `GetCustomerOrders` to fetch all orders and payments of a customer by name.
- Created a **stored function** `GetTotalSpent` to calculate how much a customer has spent in total.

## Tools
- MySQL Workbench / DB Fiddle
- GitHub for version control

## Outcome
Gained experience in:
- Writing stored procedures with input parameters
- Writing stored functions with return values
- Using modular SQL for cleaner, reusable code
